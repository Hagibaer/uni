# University Repository for the master studies

This is just a repo to share the documents between my different devices and keep track of the university
tasks that I will have to do.


### Content

1. DS (Data Science & Business Analytics)

   This module will deal with building a prediction model using R.
  
2. Masch_Sprachverarbeitung

   This module will target the topics of text-mining. First task was solved in Java, hence this will probably stay the language for the course now.
  
3. ML (Machine Learning)

     This module will be focusing on the topic of supervised and some unsupervised learning models and their implementations in
     jupyter-notebooks. The code will most likely will be written in Python.
  
4. MVA (Multivariate Statistics)

     This module is dealing with n-dimensional data and how to get meaningful insights. The R code in this folder is mostly just auxillary code
     to check if the manual calculations have been correct.
     
5. Event Processing

     Taken from the course description: This course will deal with common event models, languages for event processing, techniques to achieve robustness, and optimisations of event processing
